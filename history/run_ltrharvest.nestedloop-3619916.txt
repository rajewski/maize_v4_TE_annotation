06:51:15 PM: Contig names from initial GFF3 have already been converted. Skipping to indexing.
06:51:15 PM: Indexing of genome is already complete. Skipping to complementing.
06:51:15 PM: Complement already created. So let's make a FASTA file of those areas.
06:51:15 PM: Subtracted FASTA already created. Let's move on to indexing it.
06:51:15 PM: Running Suffixerator to make genome index.
07:04:49 PM: Done.
07:04:49 PM: First round subtraction LTR Harvest output file found, so I'm skipping ahead to round 2.
07:04:49 PM: Running round 2 subtraction.
07:04:49 PM: Indexing NIOBT_r1.0.subtract1.fa for subtraction.
07:04:54 PM: Done.
07:04:54 PM: Locating previously identified TEs in round 1 gff3.
